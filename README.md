# Welcome

This is a list of my projects, tests and experiments I think worth a mention. You can find all my projects that I host on GitHub at [github.com/gheja](https://github.com/gheja) .

I mostly code what I find interesting or think I'll find useful later, these are not part of my job (however I used to be a web developer team lead a long time ago), these are merely experiments, pet projects and game jam entries.

Browser games are a recurring thing I do as I find them great opportunities to test an idea and finish it before a hard deadline.

# My projects
